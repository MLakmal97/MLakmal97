I'm an IT professional with 4 years of experience as an Oracle Database Administrator. I am now expanding my expertise into Windows Server administration, Linux systems, and Cybersecurity. My current focus is mastering DevOps tools and Python automation to build secure, efficient, and scalable IT solutions.

I enjoy working on hands-on projects — from configuring Group Policies and managing Active Directory to creating automation scripts and exploring containerized environments with Docker. I'm passionate about continuous learning and applying my skills to solve real-world problems.

This portfolio is a reflection of my transition from database management into system administration and DevOps, showcasing the projects, skills, and certifications I’m building along the way.

- 👀 I’m interested in Windows Server Administration, Linux, Cybersecurity, DevOps, Python development, and IT education.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows Server, Docker, Linux, and Python, aiming to master DevOps and Cybersecurity skills.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on IT training content, system automation projects, open-source tools, and beginner-friendly cybersecurity resources.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I teach students and enjoy breaking down complex tech topics into simple lessons.
